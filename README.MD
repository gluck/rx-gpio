rx-rpi-gpio.js
==========

Control Raspberry Pi GPIO pins with rxjs / node.js

## Setup
See this guide on how to get [node.js running on Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/node-embedded-development/installing-node-dot-js).

This module can then be installed with npm:
```
$ npm install rx-rpi-gpio
```

### Dependencies

This modules leverages [onoff](https://github.com/fivdi/onoff) to access the GPIO port, and some pieces of [rpi-gpio](https://github.com/JamesBarwell/rpi-gpio.js) were copied to support Raspberry pin layout discovery (aka _rpi_ mpde, as opposed to default _bcm_).
